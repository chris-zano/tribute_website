# FCC-Tribute-Website

This project is a certificate project from freecodecamp.org
It is a tribute website to commemorate the first president of Ghana, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah
This project has two files: an index.html, which contains the markup for the tribute website to be diplayed in browsers - and a style.css file which holds the css styling for the index page.
The default styling for this platform is compatib.e with all devices, thus there are no media queries.
